# 🏠 House Painting Lab — FreeCodeCamp

This project was built as part of the FreeCodeCamp CSS Positioning Lab, titled _"Build a House Painting"_.

In this creative lab, I used HTML and CSS to construct a stylized house composed entirely of `<div>` elements. The focus of the project is on mastering layout properties such as:

- `position: relative` and `absolute`
- `top`, `left`, `right`, and `bottom` offsets
- `z-index` layering
- Custom shapes using borders and border-radius
- Decorative effects with gradients and shadows

### 🎨 Elements included

- Roof (rectangular or triangular)
- Chimney layered behind the house
- Windows with oblique light reflection using linear-gradient
- Door with rounded top, center line, and golden handle
- Steps with stacked layout using `bottom` positioning

### 💡 Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3 (no frameworks used)
